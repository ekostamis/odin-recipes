		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This light and flavorful caprese pizza is ready when the tomatoes are just heated through and the mozzarella cheese is slightly melted.
		 If you want a little more on this pizza, it'd be delicious with a few slices of prosciutto.</p> 
		<p>Chef tip: let your dough come up to room temperature before you stretch it--it'll make it much easier to work with.</p>
